    
The objective of this webpage is to display my Computer Science Capstone class final project. The goal of this project was to take code I had submitted in a previous class and enhance it in software design/engineering, algorithms/data structures, and database categories. The code that I have selected to enhance is code I wrote for the Software Testing and Automation class at Southern New Hampshire University. 

When I first started my Computer Science degree at Southern New Hampshire University I knew only the very basicss of coding. I had previously written very simple code I had learned from tutorials and had taken a few courses at freecodecamp, but for the most part I was a begineer when it came to writing and managing code. It was a bit challenging at first as I was learnig each new concept but as time went on and I became more and more confident each class became a little less frustrating and great deal more fun. I quickly realized that I had made the right choice in selecting computer science as my major. 

I have learned so many great things here at SNHU. I learned how to work collaboratively in a team environment in the collaboration and team project class. In this class we all go the chance to work on a single project where we learned how to create branches and create push/pull requests to work as one to complete a single goal. I really enjoyed this class because it gave me a glimpse into how things may be once I land a job and get to be part of a team working on projects together. In the software development life-cycle class I learned all about what it was like being a member of an agile based scrum team. In this class I learned how each member has certain roles and I also learned what each of those roles did and how they interacted and communicated with stake holders. I feel like this class did a really good job of giving insight into what goes on during the many stages of a products life-cylce and how each members roles play into the bigger picture. I gained a great deal of insight into how important security is when I am writing code in the software security class. In this class I learned how to write secure code and how to handle errors in a way that doesn't give attackers the advantage. I also learned how to protect user data using various encryption/decryption tactics and a great deal about which encyption protocols were the most secure. In the client and server development class I learned all about using MongoDB and how to combine it with python using the Pymongo library. This class taught me a great deal about incorporating databases into my applications to create a form of long term storage so that information could be retrieved later for various uses. These are just a few examples of the many things I have learned in my four years here at SNHU, and it only scratches the surface of the many talents I have acquired along the way. 



    
# **Original Code:**
The original code was designed to allow users to create contacts, it also had functionality that allowed users to edit, and add or remove contacts on an array. I chose this particular code base because it was something I designed very early in my Computer Science journey so I was excited to see how I could improve it now that my skills have grown. The code is very basic in structure and one thing I noticed during my initial code review is that it was severely lacking in comments, input validation, and error handling.

The original code base can be seen [HERE](https://github.com/JMckinney13/JMckinney13.github.io/blob/main/Contact.java) and [HERE](https://github.com/JMckinney13/JMckinney13.github.io/blob/main/ContactService.java)
