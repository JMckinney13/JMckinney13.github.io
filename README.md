    
The objective of this webpage is to display my Computer Science Capstone class final project. The goal of this project was to take code I had submitted in a previous class and enhance it in software design/engineering, algorithms/data structures, and database categories. The code that I have selected to enhance is code I wrote for the Software Testing and Automation class at Southern New Hampshire University. 

    
# **Original Code:**
The original code was designed to allow users to create contacts, it also had functionality that allowed users to edit, and add or remove contacts on an array. I chose this particular code base because it was something I designed very early in my Computer Science journey so I was excited to see how I could improve it now that my skills have grown. The code is very basic in structure and one thing I noticed during my initial code review is that it was severely lacking in comments, input validation, and error handling.
